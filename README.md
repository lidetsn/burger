# Eat-Da-Burger! 
   Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured .

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` and `Delete!` button. When the user clicks `Devour it!`, the burger will move to the right side of the page. When the user clicks `Delete!`, the burger will be deleted (just in case when you want to change your mind :). )

* The app store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not unless it is deleted.

Technology used
 * MySQL, 
 * Node, 
 * Express, 
 * Handlebars and a homemade ORM 
 * css
 * bootstrap
 
  It follows the MVC design pattern; and  use Node and MySQL to query and route data , and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
